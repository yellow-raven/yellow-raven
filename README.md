### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am FranÃ§ois, and I love building new things that solve problems.
I picked up coding to develop MVPs to validate or invalidate my business ideas quickly and cheaply through early user feedback. On the way, I developed a passion for everything data - particularly analytics engineering. I am learning by the day and not afraid of exploring unchartered territories.

### Project ideas:

- More geographical data projects (CPG sales, mining, city-related use cases)
